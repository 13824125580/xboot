# XBOOT Application Development Guide

# Introduction

The operation of a GPIO, you need to carefully control the chip manual, so cumbersome; for a master chip, all work from scratch; want to develop a modern point to support a variety of dynamic UI, found almost impossible things; The virtual machine technology is very popular, very powerful, like their own transplant, but difficult; or let go of their own, so XBOOT to solve these problems for you. XBOOT is not only a powerful, portability, code reuse rate of the embedded system bootloader, but also a SOC chip system application software execution engine, without complex operating system, APP power direct implementation. Once written, running everywhere, not just a slogan, but also the only reason for the existence of XBOOT. Some basic features are briefly listed as follows:

* Support lua virtual machine
* Support many protocol stacks
* Support graphics library, and vector font
* Supports a modern GUI, and animations
* Multi-platform support
* Bus drivers, UART, I2C, SPI and so on
* Device drivers, GPIO, PWM, IRQ, CLK, LED, BUZZER, VIBRATOR, WATCHDOG, RNG, FRAMEBUFFER, RTC, etc.
* Support application using lua, which include high-level API, can operate a variety of hardware abstract interface directly
* Application software platform has nothing to do, write once, run everywhere
